Version 0.12 (April 20, 1999):

* Now compiles under IRIX, and using non-GCC compilers.

* Workaround for the Linux/libpcap bug that prevented tcpflow from
  listening to packets on the loopback interface.  Someday I may try
  to fix either libpcap or the Linux kernel so that this fix is not
  necessary.

* 


Version 0.11 (April 13, 1999):

* Support for older (libc5) Linux systems (submited by Johnny Tevessen
  <j.tevessen@gmx.net>).

* Some minor fixes.


Version 0.10 (April 12, 1999):

* First public release.
