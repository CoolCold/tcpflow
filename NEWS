Version 0.12 (April 20, 1999):

* Now compiles under IRIX, and using non-GCC compilers.

* Workaround for the Linux/libpcap bug that prevented tcpflow from
  listening to packets on the loopback interface.  It's not perfect;
  it's impossible libpcap's filtering doesn't work; so, when using Linux
  to listen to the loopback interface, *all* flows on that interface are
  recorded.  Someday I may try to fix either libpcap or the Linux
  kernel so that this workaround is not necessary.


Version 0.11 (April 13, 1999):

* Support for older (libc5) Linux systems (submited by Johnny Tevessen
  <j.tevessen@gmx.net>).

* Some minor fixes.


Version 0.10 (April 12, 1999):

* First public release.
