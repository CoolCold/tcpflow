Version 0.20 (February 26, 2001):

* A bug was fixed that caused out-of-order reassembly to generate
seemingly very large files on some systems (specifically, those that
support fgetpos/fsetpos).

* Bug fixed that caused the interface to be left in promiscuous mode
after tcpflow terminated

* The -r option was added, contributed by Jose M. Alcaide
<jose@we.lc.ehu.es>

* We now distribute tcpflow RPMs, thanks to a spec file submitted by
  Ross Golder <rossigee@bigfoot.com>.


Version 0.12 (April 20, 1999):

* Now compiles under IRIX, and using non-GCC compilers.

* Workaround for the Linux/libpcap bug that prevented tcpflow from
  listening to packets on the Linux loopback interface.  It's not
  perfect -- it appears impossible to install a libpcap filtering
  expression when listening to the Linux loopback interface.  Thus,
  *all* flows on that interface are recorded.  Someday I may try to
  fix either libpcap or the Linux kernel so that this workaround is
  not necessary.


Version 0.11 (April 13, 1999):

* Support for older (libc5) Linux systems (submitted by Johnny Tevessen
  <j.tevessen@gmx.net>).

* Some minor fixes.


Version 0.10 (April 12, 1999):

* First public release.
