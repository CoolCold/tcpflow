Supported Platforms
===================

I've personally compiled and tested tcpflow on the following platforms:

    FreeBSD 2.2.8
    Solaris 2.5.1
    SunOS 4.1.3
    Linux kernel 2.0.36
    Linux kernel 2.2.5

If you have any reports of tcpflow working (or breaking) on other
platforms, please let me know.


Installing tcpflow
==================

tcpflow requires the pcap library from LBL; first, download it from
ftp://ftp.ee.lbl.gov/libpcap.tar.Z and install it using

   ./configure
   make
   make install
   make install-incl

Next, you can compile and install tcpflow like this:

   ./configure
   make
   make install

If your pcap library is installed somewhere that the compiler can't find
it, use the --with-pcap=PATH option to tell 'configure' where it is.  For
example:
   ./configure --with-pcap=../libpcap-0.4

Next, take a look at the man page to see how it works.
