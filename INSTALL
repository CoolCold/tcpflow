Supported Platforms
===================

I've personally compiled and tested tcpflow 0.11 on the following platforms:

    FreeBSD 2.2.1-RELEASE
    FreeBSD 2.2.8-RELEASE
    FreeBSD 3.1-RELEASE
    Solaris 2.6
    SunOS 4.1.3
    SunOS 4.1.3 U1
    IRIX 6.5
    Linux kernel 2.0.36, glibc2 (RedHat 5.2)
    Linux kernel 2.2.5, glibc2 (RedHat 5.2 with kernel 2.2 upgrade RPMs)

Others have reported it compiling successfully under:

    Linux kernel 2.2.5, libc5

If you have any reports of tcpflow working (or breaking) on other
platforms, please let me know (jelson@circlemud.org).


Installing tcpflow
==================

tcpflow requires the pcap library from LBL; first, download it from
ftp://ftp.ee.lbl.gov/libpcap.tar.Z and install it using

   ./configure
   make
   make install
   make install-incl
   make install-man

Next, you can compile and install tcpflow like this:

   ./configure
   make
   make install

If your pcap library is installed somewhere that the compiler can't find
it, use the --with-pcap=PATH option to tell 'configure' where it is.  For
example:
   ./configure --with-pcap=../libpcap-0.4

Next, take a look at the man page to see how it works.
