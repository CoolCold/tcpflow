	* main.c (main): libpcap doesn't seem to be able to handle
	filtering expressions when using DLT_NULL (the 'localhost'
	interface, usually), so we don't allow those expressions and
	print a warning if the user is trying to use one.

	* datalink.c (dl_null): We no longer check that the datalink type
	is AF_INET; this seems to be broken.  Probably a bug in libpcap.

	* tcpip.c (store_packet): Changed debug level of messages.

	* tcpip.c (store_packet): Now correctly checking the return value
	of fwrite().  Pointed out by Johnny Tevessen <j.tevessen@gmx.net>.

1999-04-13  Jeremy Elson  <jelson@circlemud.org>

	* Released version 0.11.

	* tcpip.c (process_ip): Portability: added typecast of an int to a
	long, and changed the printf format to use a long (%ld) instead of
	an int (%d).  This is because some systems define these variables
	as long to begin with.
	* tcpip.c (store_packet): Same thing.
	* util.c (init_debug): Same thing.

	* main.c (print_usage): Added function to give help.

	* sysdep.h: Linux libc5 systems have different names for certain
	structures.  Patch sent by Johnny Tevessen <j.tevessen@gmx.net>
	
	* configure.in: All system header files are now detected by
	autoconf and conditionally included in sysdep.h.
	* sydep.h: Same.
	* main.c: Same.
	* tcpip.c: Same.

	* Makefile.am (EXTRA_DIST): Changed from tcpflow.1 to tcpflow.1.in
	to reflect the fact that tcpflow.1 is now created by 'configure'.
	* configure.in: Same.
	* tcpflow.1.in: Same.
	
	* AUTHORS: Created & added initial entries.

	* Initial public release.
